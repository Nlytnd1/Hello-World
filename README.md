# Hello-World
My name is DJ. I am here, interested in expanding my knowledge on all this computer stuff. I don't really know what to call it. Since it seems to be as vast as this universe. I'm definitely not your average joe to say the least. I like rap music, i like computers, i like skateboarding, I like learning, I like challenges, I like facts, I like results.
